#### Neo4J Introduction
https://neo4j.com/

Neo4j stores and manages data in its more natural, connected state, maintaining data relationships that deliver lightning-fast queries, deeper context for analytics, and a pain-free modifiable data model.
Neo4j provides its own implementation of graph theory concepts. Letâ€™s take an in-depth look at the Labeled Property Graph Model in the Neo4j database. It has the following components:

Nodes (equivalent to vertices in graph theory). These are the main data elements that are interconnected through relationships. A node can have one or more labels (that describe its role) and properties (i.e. attributes).
Relationships (equivalent to edges in graph theory). A relationship connects two nodes that, in turn, can have multiple relationships. Relationships can have one or more properties.
Labels. These are used to group nodes, and each node can be assigned multiple labels. Labels are indexed to speed up finding nodes in a graph.
Properties. These are attributes of both nodes and relationships. Neo4j allows for storing data as key-value pairs, which means properties can have any value (string, number, or boolean).
